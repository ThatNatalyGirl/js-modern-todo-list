For the HW

we want things as loosely coupled as possible

The to-do list items don't know about each other or that they are even in lists
it knows what the text is and when it's done

js comment block

How to seperate it out - *TODO ITEM*
-Each item has a set of things to do to itself
	- string, done button
	- what does it need to know
		-inner html (text)
		-if it's done (boolean) when we toggle the done button it should change the boolean true and false 
	- There's also the dom manipulation of it
		-li
			-p
				-button	

OUTSIDE OF THAT
	- Whole list
	- input field
		-type in there and they click enter
			- an item gets created using the string (DOM)
	- Items themselves
		- items is an array of todo items
	- Current items counter and how many are done counter
		- check how many items are in the array
